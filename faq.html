          <h3>What is League of Legends Boosting?</h3>
          <p>
            League of Legends boosting is a service that helps players increase
            their in-game rank or ELO through the assistance of a professional
            booster. Whether you want to reach a higher rank or get better
            performance in ranked games, boosting can help you achieve your
            goals.

          <h3>How does the boosting process work?</h3>
          <p>
            After you place an order, our professional booster will work on your
            account to help you reach your desired rank. You can track the
            progress through your dashboard and even chat with your booster for
            updates.

          <h3>Is my account safe during the boost?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, we take your account security very seriously. All of our
            boosters follow strict security measures to ensure your account
            remains safe and your privacy is respected.

          <h3>How long does it take to complete a boost?</h3>
          <p>
            The time it takes depends on your current rank and the desired rank.
            Typically, a boost can take anywhere from a few hours to several
            days. Once you place your order, you'll receive an estimated
            completion time.

          <h3>Can I play on my account during the boost?</h3>
          <p>
            We recommend not playing on your account during the boost to avoid
            any interruptions or potential delays. However, if you need to play,
            please let your booster know in advance.

            agreed timeframe. Please refer to our refund policy for full
            details.
